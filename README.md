# EXPOSURE MODEL

we present a novel methodology  for estimating exposure to air pollution, which incorporates the population mobility at the 
geographical level and the daily activities performed, in addition to the traditional parameters (time and concentration). 
This research was developed in three stages. First of all, the PM2.5 concentrations at the site of interest were modeled through 
WRF/CALPUFF.   Exposure to PM2.5 were then calculated using two methodologies: (i) static exposure assessed at an individual's 
residential location  , and (ii) dynamic exposure assessed based on the locations an individual undertakes out-of-home activities 
and trips. Finally, we compared both models with considering specific movements for one standard working day , according to the ODS 
in the MMA.
